# Data Sources and Attribution

## Overview
GeneSphere uses real, de-identified cancer genomics data from publicly available research databases. The primary source is **TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas)**, with supplementary information from other public databases.

## Primary Data Sources

### The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
- **Source:** National Cancer Institute (NCI) and National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)
- **URL:** https://www.cancer.gov/tcga
- **Data Used:** 
  - Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) somatic mutation data
  - Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC) mutation data
  - Real patient tumor samples (de-identified)
- **Access Method:** Via cBioPortal API (https://www.cbioportal.org/api)
- **Studies:**
  - `luad_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018` - 230 samples
  - `lusc_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018` - 178 samples
- **Sample IDs:** Format `TCGA-XX-XXXX-XX` (e.g., `TCGA-05-4244-01`)

**What This Means:**
- ✅ Real mutation data from actual patient tumors
- ✅ De-identified per HIPAA standards
- ✅ Published in peer-reviewed literature
- ✅ Gold standard for cancer genomics research

**Citation:**
```
The results published here are in whole or part based upon data generated by 
the TCGA Research Network: https://www.cancer.gov/tcga
```


## Supplementary Reference Sources

These sources are used for **clinical annotation and validation**, NOT as primary mutation data:

### 1. NCBI Gene Database
- **URL:** https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene
- **Usage:** Gene descriptions, normal function information
- **Scripts:** `enrich_top_genes.py`, `fetch_lung_cancer_gene_data.py`
- **Role:** Enriching gene metadata

### 2. Manual Curation from Clinical Literature
- **Source:** `curated_lung_cancer_genes.sql` (hand-curated)
- **References:** NCCN Guidelines, OncoKB, COSMIC, clinical trials literature
- **Usage:** Therapy information, prevalence statistics, clinical context
- **Role:** Adding FDA-approved drug information and clinical interpretation

## Data Quality & Validation

### Mutation Data (Primary)
- ✅ Sourced from TCGA tumor sequencing
- ✅ Published in peer-reviewed studies
- ✅ Validated against germline samples
- ✅ Annotated for clinical significance

### Gene Annotations (Supplementary)
- ✅ Cross-referenced with NCBI Gene
- ✅ Therapy info from FDA labels and clinical trials
- ✅ Prevalence from published literature
- ✅ Clinical guidelines (NCCN, ESMO, ASCO)

### Quality Assurance Scripts
- `check_gene_data_quality.sh` - Validates gene data completeness
- `enrich_top_genes.py` - Fetches NCBI annotations
- `fetch_tcga_lung_cancer_data.py` - Downloads TCGA mutations via cBioPortal API

## Patient Sample IDs
Sample IDs (e.g., `TCGA-05-4244-01`) are:
- ✅ Anonymized codes
- ✅ Cannot be reverse-engineered to identify individuals
- ✅ Compliant with genomic data sharing policies
